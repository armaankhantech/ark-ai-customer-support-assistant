# ARK AI Customer Support Assistant
 
An AI-powered customer support chat system: a browser chat widget talks to an Express backend, which triggers an n8n workflow that retrieves conversation history, grounds responses in real business data, runs a local LLM (Ollama / Qwen3 8B), and logs everything to PostgreSQL.
 
**Status: v1 — working end-to-end pipeline with conversation memory, business knowledge grounding, and a premium streaming chat UI. Active development.**
 
The assistant remembers prior messages within a session, answers business-specific questions (hours, services, refund policy) from a trusted data source instead of guessing, and responds with "I don't have that information" when asked something outside that data. Category classification is currently non-functional (hardcoded) — see Known Issues.

# 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---------|------------|
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js |
| Automation | n8n |
| AI | Ollama running Qwen3 8B (local inference, `think: false` mode) |
| Database | PostgreSQL — `messages` (conversation history), `support_tickets` (ticket log) |
| Tunneling | ngrok (for exposing local n8n webhook) |

## Known Issues
 
- **Category classification is not currently functional.** Category is hardcoded to `"general"` in the workflow. The original zero-shot classification attempt was unreliable (e.g. "i can't login" was classified as "cancellation" instead of "account_access") and was dropped entirely when the prompt pipeline was rebuilt to support conversation memory, rather than shipping two half-working features at once. Re-implementing classification without breaking memory is planned.
- **No authentication on session IDs.** Session IDs are generated client-side and stored in `localStorage` with no server-side validation. Anyone who obtains or guesses a session ID can read or append to that conversation's history. Acceptable for a portfolio v1; would need fixing before any real deployment.
- **Business knowledge is static, not dynamic.** `companyInfo.js` is hardcoded into the deployed backend. Updating business hours, services, or refund policy requires a code change and redeploy — there's no admin interface or database-backed config yet. Fine for a portfolio demo, not production-grade.
- **Response latency depends on local hardware running Ollama;** not optimized for concurrent users.

## 📚 What I Learned
 
Building AI memory is not just storing messages. It requires session management, conversation retrieval, prompt engineering, response persistence, and workflow orchestration.
 
Grounding an AI in trusted data is not just adding more context to a prompt. It requires a single source of truth, a clear path for that data to reach the model on every request, and an explicit instruction for the model to admit what it doesn't know instead of guessing.
 
Building a streaming, markdown-aware chat UI also surfaced a subtler lesson: rendering partial markdown character-by-character means intermediate states (like a half-typed code fence language tag) are technically invalid input to downstream parsers, and need to be handled deliberately rather than assumed away.

## Roadmap
 
- [ ] Re-implement category classification without breaking conversation memory
- [ ] Add authentication / server-side validation for session IDs
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting on Express layer
- [ ] Deploy frontend to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Conversation summarization for long sessions beyond the rolling window
- [ ] Move business knowledge from static file to database-backed config
